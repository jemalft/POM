POM is statands for Page Object Model:is a technique that used to model test page screen as 
an object while creating test Automation script.In this project I am trying to use the following 
technologies to get the test automation in POM.
-Selenium WebDriver interface
-TestNG Famework/Junits
-Java-as a programming language
-eclipse IDE
-Maven build tool
-Jenkins Countinous Integration Tool(CI)

I am creating Hybrid Automation Framework that can be used as a reference for any web applications.
1.The first step will be creating automation framework folder stracture
2.Create Test scripts from Test cases 
3.Prepare Test data and store DOM objects in object repository file
4.Test suits contains the logics to verify
5.Create reporting modules,capture screenshots,HTM based logs and HTML based report/chart report[excution summery/Test script result/Error log/
6.excute script on various browsers as per needed
please have a look (diagrame 11) to understand different layers of the Automation Framework
